# SelfBot-Oodle
A simple Discord bot written in C# that's main purpose was to change every vowel in a sentence to "oodle" but has now added two other commands

## .oodle
Changes every vowel to "oodle". Uses a temporary char (Default: '~') to indicate replace location.

## .makeitdouble
Doubles every vowel in a sentence.

## .pfp (Not Working)
Retrieves a profile picture from a mentioned person and saves it to a file.
